To run the code, you will have to go along the path of Pinata\x64\Debug.
There you will see the file Pinata.exe. It is out executable file.
The executable file accepts inputs in form of numbers, separated by symbols. For simplicity and safety, I've made the program treat all symbols as separators - except for the "-" symbol, which is used for indicating the negativity of the number. Negative numbers are not allowed in our task, so the execution of the program will stop once it spots a "-" in the input.
So feel free to input stuff like {2;4;3;8}, the application will treat the input as four separate numbers.
