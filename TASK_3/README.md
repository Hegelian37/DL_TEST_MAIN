To run the code, you will have to go through Weban\x64\Debug.
There you will see two .csv files, Weban.exe file, and launch.bat file.
Double-click on the launch.bat to launch the program.
Output produced by the program in the command line is dependent on the input, which is these two .csv files: dayone.csv and daytwo.csv.
To edit .csv files, one can safely change their extension into .txt and edit the code manually, while keeping in mind that the values in a row must be separated into columns by either a comma (,) or a semicolon (;).
For simplicity, the categories of pages are separated into abstracts like "home", "account", "product_NO", but you are free to enter whatever you want - yet the user ID should be an integer.
