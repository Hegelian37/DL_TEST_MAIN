To run the code, you will have to go to the Crawler folder.
There you will see folders bin, node_modules, and obj - as well as a lot of different .bat files.
The presented .bat files are testing files representing different inputs. You are free to double-click all of them and see the results.
Output produced by the program in the command line is dependent on the input done through the batch file, which contains a link to the main file index.js - and an initial Wikipedia link. For example, the "fall_weiss.bat" will contain the link to the Fall Weiss operation: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fall_Weiss_(1939)
You can create your own batch files. For simplicity, you can take ready .bat files and just change the link into whatever else Wikipedia link you want.
